## About the project

You can view the project here - [http://freelancify.alpibo.com/](http://freelancify.alpibo.com/)

Make sure to register a new account and test it out without having to download anything.

This project is one of my first [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) projects that make it possible to have back-end functionality without having to manage a server, a database and its security. Authentication is handled by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and the database-related functionality is handled by Google's real-time database [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore).

To achieve the connection between Redux and Firebase/Firestore API's, the [react-redux-firebase](http://react-redux-firebase.com/) library has been used.

For the UI components [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) has been used.
